# Note-Taker

# Description
This is an app that allows the user to write notes about anything and keep a reminder for themselves.
Whether the user is a college student keeping up with their schedule, or a busy mom keeping track of the kids activities, this is a great app to stay organised.

# App Directions
Upon entering the site, the user is directed to enter a note title and the actual note. After completing the body of the note the user can save the note in a list.

# Future Features
In the future I am going to get it to be able to delete the old notes the user does not need anymore.
